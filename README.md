# prime_quickfire_1
Create a new folder called "Quickfire Challenge"
Inside that folder include:
- index.html file. Make sure the body has a P tag that says 'quickfire challenge'
- style.css, target the P tag and change its color to red
- app.js, have a console.log that reads "Quickfire challenge"

Check it into Github under the repo name "prime_quickfire_1"

Shoot me an email with the repo link once you are finished titled "Quickfire Challenge"

Bonus: Create a readme file from GitHub, change the title to read "Quickfire Challenge #1" in an H1 tag.

In regular text, include the date.
